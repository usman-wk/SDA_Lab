📄 Brief Introduction:
The Department & Discipline Management System is a desktop-based software solution designed to streamline the management of university academic departments, their disciplines, and user roles (such as Admins, Department Heads, and Students).
The system allows Admins to create and assign department heads, manage user roles, and oversee the structural organization of departments. Department Heads are empowered to manage the disciplines under their assigned departments. Students can view their personal profiles along with the relevant academic information, such as their assigned department and discipline.
By offering role-based access and modular functionality, the system enhances administrative efficiency, reduces manual paperwork, and improves transparency across academic entities.
The main goal of the system is to ensure that users at different levels of access can seamlessly perform their responsibilities within the academic hierarchy. It reduces administrative overhead, minimizes human error, ensures role-based data privacy, and promotes centralized, structured control over academic entities.

🔍 Purpose of the System:
In many educational institutions, maintaining updated records of departments, disciplines (specializations or degree programs), and user data (students and faculty) is done manually or through disconnected systems. This leads to issues such as data duplication, inefficiency in management, limited access control, and lack of accountability.
